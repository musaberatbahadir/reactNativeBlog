# React Native Blog Application
This application was built with React Native for using Blog APIs.
These APIs were constructed on [LaravelBlog](https://github.com/musaberatbahadir/laravelBlog) with Laravel 5.4 .

### Installation
First you have to get this repo ([LaravelBlog](https://github.com/musaberatbahadir/laravelBlog)) for local server.
Then you have to install React Navigation with :
```sh
$ npm install --save react-navigation
```

### Future Works
I am going to add search feature which I have already prepared its API.
